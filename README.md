# Assumptions
In my interpretation of the assumptions, updates to the chips/user balance can only be done server-side. With regards to the game in action, I assume the logic can be done locally, with updates to the history going through verification (such as checking cards aren't changed between turns, etc.).

Players dont have direct update permissions on the game table, instead, they update the current game through a postgres function in supabase.
